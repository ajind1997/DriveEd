        DriverED is a friendly, trusted and professional driving school that helps people learn the skills they need to get their driver’s licence.\n\n
        We help people that find it hard to practise driving for a range of reasons, such as lack of access to a car, difficulty finding a suitable instructor, and the high cost of regular driving lessons.\n\n
        We’ll match you with a fully trained, qualified driving instructor, so you can be sure you’re learning from a professional that will help you get the experience you need. Everyone is welcome to take part and we can tailor lessons to make sure they are right for you, by providing instructors who are multilingual, from different cultural backgrounds or a particular gender. We have specialised experience in working with people who are migrants, refugees, or don’t speak much English.
